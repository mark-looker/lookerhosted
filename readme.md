DONE
Create HTML on fields-  Yep can do this- just use this code: html:
<p style="color: red; font-size: 50px; font-family:courier">{{ value }}</p>;;
Put in a logo- I have done this directly on a dashboard.  I tried using other styling elements - e.g wanted to change the background, but it uses HTML 'markdown' which uses just a limited set of HTML attributes.
Conditional formatting

Understand more how GIT works
GIT is intgrated with Looker so that you can version control LookML files.  All LookML files are synced? with my [repo] (https://github.com/mark-looker/lookerhosted).  I learned that I can review a history of what I have changed in LookML.  I can also add files to my GIT repo in GIT and see the changes in Looker.
Use Action Hub- done this to schedule PDFs to Google drive.  Used Zapier and though Webhook didnt work for this- did manage using Zapier email attachment.

Use Liquid- done uses {{ value}} to insert a value.  Try doing some conditional formatting with it!

Included an image in my Products dashboard- didn't use LookML
Included a favicon as an image in my use of HTML for adding in ... sub links to other places.
